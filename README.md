I'm a professional software developer currently looking for new opportunities.  
I enjoy developing complex, feature-rich websites that solve real-world problems.

I began my career in software development with building automation, which gave me hands-on experience with cyber-physical systems.  
Currently, I'm exploring neural networks and machine learning just for fun.

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS – with some experience in C#, C++, and Python
